## Abstract 
Avatars in virtual reality (VR) increase the immersion and provide an interface between the user's physical body and the virtual world. Avatars enable referential gestures, which are essential for targeting, selection, locomotion, and collaboration in VR. However, players of immersive games can have another virtual appearance deviating from human-likeness and previous work suggests that avatars can have an effect on the accuracy of referential gestures in VR. One of the most important referential gestures is mid-air pointing. It has been shown that mid-air pointing is affected by systematic errors, which can be compensated using different methods. Thus, it is unknown if the avatar must be considered in corrections of the systematic error. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the avatar on pointing accuracy. We show that the systematic error in pointing is significantly affected by the virtual appearance but does not correlate with the degree to which the appearance deviates from the perceived human-likeness. Moreover, we confirm that people only rely on their fingertip and not on their forearm or index finger orientation. We present compensation models and contribute with design implications to increase the accuracy of pointing in VR.
